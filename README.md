# Website Blocker for Windows/Max/Linux
MOTIVATION:
-created it because I wanted to get rid of distracting pages when working (reddit, twitch, email...)
-it takes 23-29min to get back on track when interupted or distracted == a big loss of productivity (just read studies that show)
-did not trust any of the available software (hard to uninstall/shady tracking history) or firefox addons

FUNCTIONALITY/FEATURES:
-could create it to keep certain websites offline for certain hours of the day, but since work schedule not constant, decided with specified amount of time
-redirects website to chosen ip, in our case the local host

HOW IT WORKS:
-it will block all websites in the array for a specified amount of time.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-needs Node to run
